            Hi, I’m Jamie a full stack developer from NYC. I love building web applications using React and NodeJS as well as thinking through data structures and working with large data sets. I think broadly and critically having a background in economics, political science and international development, but enjoy, above all, the ability to creatively solve problems and build things with code.  While my side hustles in sales, fundraising and even as a tour guide have proven strong communication skills, I only recently discovered how to leverage these skills in the agile, scrum work environment which has helped me learn at a rapid pace and quickly add value to my team. I am excited to build on these skills, learn from others and gain experience to grow into a great developer so I can manage my own team in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I have been coding for 6 months, I am transitioning careers after two years as a senior research analyst which has given me a strong foundation working with databases, large data sets and writing technical documentation. My job grew into a management role instructing our vendors in India how to enter data into the companies proprietary database. I began spending more time thinking thinking how to improve data collection and maintenance than working with the data once sent back which led me to enroll in a part-time intro to web development course centered on Ruby. I was energized by the challenges and learning environment a career in programming could offer, so I left my job to enroll in a full time web development bootcamp of four months where I learned Javascript, React/Redux, Node.js/Express, Python, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL while building web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scroll down to discover recent projects. Family-Page helped my remote family share photos and videos while solving the challenge of group messaging in SMS. I was also able to apply technology to one of my passions, public transportation allowing me to answer a shallow hypothesis about the Citibike stations and their distance from NYC metro stations. I was blown away when I was first able to write a program to analyze data. Customizing these questions was a breakthrough in what I could do with the ability to program. I can’t wait for more epiphanies like these to come as I continue to learn.

              I’m a full stack developer from NYC. I love building
              web applications with React and NodeJS as well as learning Python to explore data.
              My educational background is in economics and political science, and I have an MPA
              in international development from Tsinghua University in China. I think broadly and critically
              about meaningful and challenging problems and coding has given me the opportunity to explore all of these passions
              on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before coding, I was a senior research analyst for two years at a private telecommunications company.
              My job grew into a management role instructing our vendor in India on data entry. While working to improve data collection, I became interested in databases and tools to improve work flow which led me to enroll in a
              part-time intro to web development course centered
              on Ruby. I was energized by the challenges and learning environment
              a career in programming could offer, which motivated me to leave this job and enroll in a full
              time web development bootcamp of four months where I learned Javascript,
              React/Redux, NodeJS/Express, Mocha/Chai MongoDB/Mongoose, PostgreSQL and Python, while
              building web applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Side Projects</h3>
            <p>
              I am currently building Family-Page as a React Native app to make it more accessible
              to family members while learning React Native.
            </p>

            <h3>What I'm Really Good At</h3>
            <p>
              I have high emotional intelligence which drives me to work well on teams
              and communicate effectively. I
              recently discovered how to leverage these skills in the agile, scrum work environment
              which has helped me learn at a rapid pace and quickly add value to my team.
            </p>
            <h3>What I'm Looking To Do Next</h3>
            <p>
              React and NodeJS are powerful tools that have allowed me to build quickly.
              I would love to continue to work with these tools as well as expand and use React Native while
              building skills as a developer. I also enjoy
              thinking through data structures and using the tools of programming to
              explore data, and would also be interested in focusing on the languages and technologies in this field.
